## What I’m great at ✨
- 🔍 *Performance:* EXPLAIN/ANALYZE mastery, plan rewrites, cache & storage strategy  
- 🧩 *Data modeling:* normalized OLTP, star/snowflake OLAP, lifecycle & archival plans  
- 🛡️ *Reliability:* RTO/RPO targets, backup integrity, restore drills that prove it works  
- 🚦 *Observability:* pg_stat*, AWR, performance_schema, Prometheus + Grafana  
- 🛠️ *Automation:* GitHub Actions, Ansible/Terraform, safe migrations with rollbacks

## Toolbelt 🧰
*Languages/Scripting:* SQL, PL/pgSQL, T-SQL, Bash, Python  
*Infra:* Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform  
*Cloud:* AWS (RDS/Aurora), GCP (Cloud SQL/BigQuery), Azure (Managed DB)  
*Backups:* pgBackRest, RMAN, Percona XtraBackup, mysqldump  
*Monitoring:* Grafana, Prometheus, ELK, pgBadger

## Highlights 🏆
- ⏱️ Reduced a critical report from minutes to seconds with indexing + plan fixes  
- 🔁 Built multi-AZ failover with near-zero RPO; quarterly game-day tested  
- 🧯 Automated restore-verify pipeline to continuously validate backups  

---

## Currently 📚
- Digging deeper into optimizer internals and advanced replication patterns  
- Building lean automation for schema reviews & migration safety nets
